# Week-1-Aicte-Intership
The project focuses on predicting future water levels of reservoirs or dams using historical data and machine learning algorithms. The idea is to help manage water resources efficiently, especially in areas dependent on reservoirs for drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power.  
🌊 Seasonal Reservoir Water Level Prediction
📘 Project Overview

This project is part of the “Focusing on Green Skills using AI Technologies” Internship conducted by Edunet Foundation and Shell.
The chosen domain is Energy, under the Prediction category — focusing on using AI and Machine Learning to forecast seasonal reservoir water levels based on historical data.

Accurate reservoir level prediction is essential for efficient water resource management, irrigation planning, and hydroelectric energy generation.

🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts seasonal variations in reservoir water levels using real-world data collected from the Central Water Commission (CWC).

📂 Dataset Details

Source: Central Water Commission (CWC)
Dataset Name: Daily Data of Reservoir Level during March 2024
File: Daily_data_of_reservoir_level_of_Central_Water_Commission_(CWC)_Agency_during_March_2024.csv
Description: Contains daily reservoir level readings for various water bodies across India.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

Performed using Python and Pandas:
Load dataset using pd.read_csv()
Handle missing values – filled or dropped NA values
Removed duplicates – ensured no repeated rows
Renamed columns – standardized names (e.g., Water_Level_m)
Converted dates – to proper datetime format
Filtered outliers – removed unrealistic water level values
Exported cleaned data as cleaned_reservoir_data.csv

💻 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Platform: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
Version Control: GitHub

📊 Next Steps (Upcoming Weeks)

Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Week 3: Build ML Model for Water Level Prediction
Week 4: Model Evaluation and Visualization of Forecast Results

🧠 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned:
How to collect and clean real-world environmental data
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Basics of machine learning-based prediction in the energy sector
Version control using GitHub
